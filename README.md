# Image-processing
# What I've done so far:

1. So far, the printed text can be extracted from images.
2. The text can be provided in the form of speech in 4 languages (Tamil, English, Telugu and French).
3. The path is hardcoded in the code for now (It'll be changed soon).

# What I'm planning on doing:

1. Using machinelearning and training with datasets to recognise the handwritten text based on the shape.
2. Code isn't structured well which will be done soon.
